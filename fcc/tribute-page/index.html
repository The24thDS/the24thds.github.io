            <p>The most influential scientist of the 20th century epoch, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is known as the Father
                of Modern Physics. He may have revolutionized scientific thought, but what made the public adore him was
                his down-to-earth sense of humor. Known for making short quips, Einstein was the peopleâ€™s scientist. Despite
                being one of the most brilliant men of the 20th century, Einstein appeared approachable, partly because he
                always had uncombed hair, disheveled clothing, and a lack of socks.</p>
            <p> During his entire life, Einstein worked diligently to understand the world around him and in so doing, developed
                the
                <strong>Theory of Relativity</strong>, which opened the door for the creation of the atomic bomb. He received a Nobel
                Prize for his contribution to the field of Theoretical Physics in the year 1921.</p>
            <em>
                <hr>"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him
                a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."
                <hr>Robert Oppenheimer</em>
